# assembly
First, you need to put the main z-axis bar into the rectangular hole on the base plate and fix them with the flathead screw on the bottom with their bearings.

Then, you need to put the coupling on the z-axis motor and put the lead screw on it. The lead screw should be going through the bearing that is connected to the head. Fix the coupling with the set screws.

Lastly, turn the yellow screws beneath the base plate for leveling. Select leveling on the screen, and put the normal A4 paper on top of the base plate. Turn the screws until the A4 paper can move through with a little bit of scratch by the nozzle. Then, you're all set!
